             <h4>
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, applications, and data from unauthorized access, 
attacks, or damage, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. 
It involves defending against threats using techniques like network security, encryption, ethical hacking,
 malware analysis, and secure software development, while also preparing for incidents through digital 
 forensics and response strategies. This field is essential in almost every modern industry,
from banking and cloud computing to software development, gaming, 
and critical infrastructure, making it a key skill set for engineers, developers, and IT professionals.
